# Recommender-System
It is a movie recommender system
Data used in this project includes users’ ID, movies’ ID and ratings. Based on Item Collaborative Filtering, firstly a matrix about users’ rating was created. Then a co-occurrence matrix was created which describes the similarity between the movies. Finally, the co-occurrence matrix and a rating matrix were combined to obtain the recommender movie list.
